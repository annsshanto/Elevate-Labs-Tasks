## 📊 Observations
- Short passwords fail quickly
- Adding symbols improves strength
- Longer passwords are much stronger

---

## 🧠 Best Practices
- Use at least 12–16 characters  
- Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols  
- Avoid personal information  
- Use password manager

## ⚔ Common Password Attacks

### Brute Force Attack
Tries all possible combinations.

### Dictionary Attack
Uses common words list.

### Credential Stuffing
Uses leaked usernames and passwords.

---

## 📝 Conclusion
Password complexity greatly increases security. Longer and random passwords take years or centuries to crack compared to simple passwords which break in seconds.
